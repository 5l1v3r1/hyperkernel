    // FUTURE
    //
    // We need to implement VMcall policies. Note that this will need a lot
    // of information about domain, process list, process and thread info,
    // as well as the specific ares to the hypercall. As a result, we will
    // likely need to create policy structs that can be created easily for
    // each hypercall.
